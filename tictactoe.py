"""
Tic Tac Toe, also known as "Noughts and Crosses," has origins dating back to ancient times. 
Early versions of the game were played in ancient Egypt around 1300 BCE and by the Romans in the 1st century BCE with a game called Terni Lapilli. 
These early forms involved marking grids or placing stones to create rows, though they often had different rules from the modern version.

The game we know today became popular in the 19th and 20th centuries as a simple pencil-and-paper pastime. 
With its straightforward rules, it spread quickly across schools and homes, becoming a favorite for children and adults alike. 
The goal was clear: alternate between X's and O's, trying to form a row of three horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

In 1952, Tic Tac Toe made history as one of the first games to be programmed into a computer with a game called OXO. 
This marked an early step in artificial intelligence, as machines could calculate moves and compete against humans. 
Today, Tic Tac Toe remains a universal game, enjoyed for its simplicity and its value in teaching logic and strategy.

This version in Python was developed for fun only so I have tic tac toe on my mac. Enjoy.
